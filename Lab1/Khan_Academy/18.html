           <p id="last_paragraph">There are many recipes for kuurdak. A common feature of all kurdaks is the roasting of pieces of meat.

The Kyrgyz and Uzbek versions usually use meat pulp, fat, and onions[1]. Kuurdak is relatively quick to prepare, so it is usually prepared when it is necessary to serve the dish quickly — if the guests are in a hurry to leave, or before the main dish beshbarmak is ready. Kuurdak can be cooked only from meat (without onions), in this case it is called "Kara kuurdak"</p>
