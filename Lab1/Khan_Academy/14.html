        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Coat 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with cooking spray; line bottoms of each cake pan with parchment paper, and spray parchment lightly with cooking spray. Set aside.
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until no lumps remain.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Combine buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Reduce speed to low, and gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in hot coffee, beating until just incorporated, about 1 minute. Divide batter evenly among the prepared cake pans, about 2 cups each.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Stir chilled frosting until smooth. Using a large offset spatula, spread frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake.</p>
