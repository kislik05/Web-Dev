    <h1>The Smile(By William Blake)</h1>
    <p>There is a Smile of Love<br>
        And there is a Smile of Deceit<br> 
        And there is a Smile of Smiles<br>
        In which these two Smiles meet<br><br>
        And there is a Frown of Hate <br>
        And there is a Frown of disdain <br>
        And there is a Frown of Frowns<br>
        Which you strive to forget in vain <br><br>
        For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core <br>
        And it sticks in the deep Back bone<br> 
        And no Smile that ever was smild <br>
        But only one Smile alone<br><br>
        That betwixt the Cradle & Grave<br>
        It only once Smild can be <br>
        But when it once is Smild<br> 
        Theres an end to all Misery <br><br>
    </p>
